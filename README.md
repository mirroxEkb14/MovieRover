# About
MovieRover is a movie search app that allows users find a certain movie/series by its name and get more detailed information about it

# Motivation
For me this project has to be a helper to whom I can turn in the future and see some code notes, some implemented functionality and also for me to practice to write Android apps. It is my entry point to the world of Android development
